### 👋 About Me

I'm a dual-degree computer scientist and biochemist with a passion for engineering secure, data-driven solutions. I specialize in:

- 🌐 Full-Stack Web Development (Node.js, Express, MariaDB, GCP)
- 🔐 Embedded Systems & Cybersecurity (WolfSSL, MAX78000FTHR, eCTF)
- 🤖 Machine Learning & Data Mining (scikit-learn, BERT, TF-IDF, GridSearchCV)
- ☁️ DevOps & Infrastructure Automation (Ansible, GitHub Actions, Docker)

I’m currently conducting DoD-funded research on autonomous vehicle navigation security and leading DIGITHREADS LLC—my own consulting initiative for web and data projects.
